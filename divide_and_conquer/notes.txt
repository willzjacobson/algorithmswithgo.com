1) *Divide* the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2) *Conquer* the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
3) *Combine* the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original prob- lem.
